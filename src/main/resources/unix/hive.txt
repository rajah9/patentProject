# I am creating a patent_abstract 'table' to read company names.
# 3M can be poorly spelled and has foreign subsidiaries. Examples:
#    3M INNOVATIVE PORPERTIES COMPANY
#    3M ESPE AG (a wholly-owned subsiduary of 3M Company)
# I am searching for good stems for Siemens, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, and Dow Chemical.
